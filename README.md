# Global Migrant Deaths

Tracking migrant deaths (2014 - 2019)

Every year, hundreds of thousands of people leave their homes in search of a better life. Many are injured or killed, while many more go missing. The [U.N.â€™s International Organization for Migration's (IOM) Missing Migrants Project](https://missingmigrants.iom.int/) tracks incidents involving migrants, including refugees and asylum-seekers, who have died or gone missing in the process of migration towards an international destination. The code for this web map can be viewed on Github.
